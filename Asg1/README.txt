./code contain 4 files of code, alignSingle.m imgAlignSingle.m alignMulti.m imgAlignMulti.m .

alignSingle.m & imgAlignSingle.m is for Single-scale Implementation and

alignMulti.m & imgAlignMulti.m is for Multi-scale Implementation.

imgAlignSingle.m and imgAlignMulti.m is the main function of the implementation.

./html contain a report html and image.

In that html, it included
- Algoritm for two implementation
- Result image for Single-scale Implementation , for Multi-scale I think it is too large so I didn't put it in.
- Discussion about the algoritm I wrote and how can I improve it further
- Extra part: using 1gradients to process image
